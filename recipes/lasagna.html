    <h2>A homemade lasagna recipe with meaty, made from-scratch tomato sauce</h2>
    <p>Homemade lasagna made with blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmasen instead of traditional ricotta.</p>
    <p>Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat</strong>:This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
        <li><strong>Onion</strong>: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
        <li><strong>Canned tomatoes</strong>: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
        <li><Strong>Fresh herbs</Strong>:For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
        <li><Strong>Sugar</Strong>: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices and seasonings</strong>: This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Noodles</strong>:Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
         <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li>
         <li><strong>Eggs</strong>:Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</li>   
    </ul>
